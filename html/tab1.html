<h3>Solar system</h3>
<p>
    <br>  
There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis." </br>
<br> Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. </br>
<br> Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</br>
        
        
<br>
        5 Need-to-Know Things About the Solar System </br>
        <br>
        1. ONE OF BILLIONS: Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.</br>
        <br>
        2. MEET ME IN THE ORION ARM: Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.</br>
        <br>
        3. A LONG WAY ROUND: It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</br>
        <br>
        4. SPIRALING THROUGH SPACE: There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. </br>
        <br> 
        5. GOOD ATMOSPHERE(S): Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds – including Earth – with many kinds of atmospheres.
        Moons come in many shapes, sizes, and types. A few have atmospheres and even hidden oceansbeneath their surfaces. Most planetary moons probably formed from the discs of gas and dust circulating around planets in the early solar system, though some are captured objects that formed elsewhere and fell into orbit around larger worlds. </br>
        <br>
        How Many Moons Are There in the Solar System? </br>
       <br> The "traditional" moon count most people are familiar with stands at 227: One moon for Earth; two for Mars; 95 at Jupiter; 83 at Saturn; 27 at Uranus; 14 at Neptune; and five for dwarf planet Pluto. According to NASA/JPL's Solar System Dynamics team, astronomers have documented more than 450 natural satellites orbiting smaller objects, such as asteroids, dwarf planets, or Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) beyond the orbit of Neptune.</br>
        Don’t let the name fool you. Our solar system’s small bodies – asteroids, comets, and meteors – pack big surprises. These chunks of rock, ice, and metal are leftovers from the formation of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. They are a lot like a fossil record of our early solar system. There are currently 1,278,987 known asteroids and 3,865 known comets.
