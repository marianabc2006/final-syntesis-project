<h3 id="one">Kepler laws and orbits</h3>
<h3 id="one">Orbits</h3>
<p>
  The planets orbit the Sun in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from above
  the Sun's north pole, and the planets' orbits all are aligned to what
  astronomers call the ecliptic plane.
</p>
<h3 id="one">Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</h3>
<p>
  Kepler's three laws describe how planetary bodies orbit the Sun. They describe
  how (1) planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun as a focus, (2) a
  planet covers the same area of space in the same amount of time no matter
  where it is in its orbit, and (3) a planet’s orbital period is proportional to
  the size of its orbit (its semi-major axis).
</p>
<p>
  After much struggle, Kepler has forced to an eventual realization that the
  orbits of the planets are not circles but were instead the elongated or
  flattened circles that geometers call ellipses. Since the orbits of the
  planets are ellipses, let us review three basic properties of ellipses.
</p>
<p>
  The first property of an ellipse: an ellipse is defined by two points, each
  called a focus, and together called foci. The sum of the distances to the foci
  from any point on the ellipse is always a constant. The second property of an
  ellipse: the amount of flattening of the ellipse is called eccentricity. The
  flatter the ellipse, the more eccentric it is. Each ellipse has an
  eccentricity with a value between zero, a circle, and one, essentially a flat
  line, technically called a parabola. The third property of an ellipse: the
  longest axis of the ellipse is called the major axis, while the shortest axis
  is called the minor axis. Half of the major axis is termed a semi-major axis.
  Knowing then that the orbits of the planets are elliptical, Johannes Kepler
  formulated three laws of planetary motion, which accurately described the
  motion of comets as well.
</p>
<h2 class="ke">Laws of Kepler</h2>
<p>
  Kepler's First Law: each planet's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse. The
  Sun's center is always located at one focus of the orbital ellipse. The Sun is
  at one focus. The planet follows the ellipse in its orbit, meaning that the
  planet to Sun distance is constantly changing as the planet goes around its
  orbit.
</p>
<p>
  Kepler's Second Law: the imaginary line joining a planet and the Sun sweep
  equal areas of space during equal time intervals as the planet orbits.
  Basically, planets do not move with constant speed along their orbits. Rather,
  their speed varies so that the line joining the centers of the Sun and the
  planet sweeps out equal parts of an area at equal times. The point of nearest
  approach of the planet to the Sun is termed perihelion. The point of greatest
  separation is aphelion, hence to Kepler's Second Law, a planet moves fastest
  when it is at perihelion and slowest at aphelion
</p>
<p>
  Kepler's Third Law: the squares of the orbital periods of the planets are
  directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits.
  Kepler's Third Law implies that the period for a planet to orbit the Sun
  increases rapidly with the radius of its orbit. Thus we find that Mercury, the
  innermost planet, takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun. The Earth takes 365
  days, while Saturn requires 10,759 days to do the same. Though Kepler hadn't
  known about gravitation when he came up with his three laws, they were
  instrumental in Isaac Newton deriving his theory of universal gravitation,
  which explains the unknown force behind Kepler's Third Law. Kepler and his
  theories were crucial in the better understanding of our solar system dynamics
  and as a springboard to newer theories that more accurately approximate our
  planetary orbits.
